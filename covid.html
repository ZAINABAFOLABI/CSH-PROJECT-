        <h5 id="covid19">COVID19 CASES IN NIGERIA</h5>
        <p id="covid text">According to the National Center for Disease Control, as of the 13th of April 2021, 74 new confirmed cases 
            were recorded in Nigeria.
            Till date, 163911 cases have been confirmed, 154225 cases have been discharged and 2061 deaths have been
            recorded in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory
            The 74 new cases are reported from 9 states- Lagos (30), Enugu (11), FCT (11), Akwa Ibom (8), Osun (5), 
            Kaduna (4), Ebonyi (2), Rivers (2), and Ekiti (1)
            A multi-sectoral national emergency operations centre (EOC), activated at Level 3, continues to coordinate
            the national response activities.</p>
            <h5 id="covid19">COVID19 VACCINE </h5>
            <p id="covid text">The impact of COVID-19 vaccines on the pandemic will depend on several factors. These include the 
                effectiveness of the vaccines; how quickly they are approved, manufactured, and delivered; the possible 
                development of other variants and how many people get vaccinated. <br>
                Whilst trials have shown several COVID-19 vaccines to have high levels of efficacy, like all other 
                vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines will not be 100% effective. WHO is working to help ensure that approved 
                vaccines are as effective as possible, so they can have the greatest impact on the pandemic.</p>
            <h5 id="covid19">BENEFITS OF GETTING VACCINATED  </h5>
            <p id="covid text">The COVID-19 vaccines produce protection against the disease, as a result of developing an immune response to the 
                SARS-Cov-2 virus.  Developing immunity through vaccination means there is a reduced risk of developing the  illness 
                and its consequences. This immunity helps you fight the virus if exposed. Getting vaccinated may also protect people 
                around you, because if you are protected from getting infected and from disease, you are less likely to infect someone else. This is particularly important to protect people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as healthcare providers, 
                older or elderly adults, and people with other medical conditions.</p>
            <h5 id="covid19">POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF COVID19 VACCINE </h5>
            <p id="covid text">Mild-to-moderate side effects, like a low-grade fever or muscle aches, are normal and not a cause for alarm: they are 
                signs that the body’s immune system is responding to the vaccine, specifically the antigen (a substance 
                that triggers an immune response), and is gearing up to fight the virus. These side effects usually go 
                away on their own after a few days.

                Common and mild or moderate side effects are a good thing: they show us that the vaccine is working.
                Experiencing no side effects doesn’t mean the vaccine is ineffective. It means everybody responds 
                differently. </p>
